# CyberGuard: IndiaAI Hackathon ðŸš€

## Project Overview
CyberGuard is an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to revolutionize cybercrime reporting systems. By accurately classifying fraud types based on victim descriptions, it addresses inefficiencies in existing processes. This project leverages cutting-edge models, unsupervised learning, manual annotation, and synthetic data generation for superior performance.
